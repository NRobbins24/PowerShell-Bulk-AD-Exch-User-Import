Active Directory / Exchange Bulk User Import Tool

Hacked together in 2012 to meet requirements to import hundreds of user accounts at once into Microsoft Active Directory. The software meets a few needs such as selecting an Exchange mailbox based on last name, a feature that may not be relevant for every organization. Additionally, some bugs are floating around and the code could use an overhaul.

For now, it will live here in case anyone on the great interwebs finds a use for it.
